;; Description: Simple Emacs restart with automatic state preservation

;;; Commentary:
;; Simple approach to restarting Emacs while preserving state:
;; - C-c q r -> Save current state and restart Emacs cleanly
;; - Uses desktop.el for robust session management
;; - Automatic state restoration on startup

;;; Code:

(require 'desktop)

;; Configure desktop to save session automatically - MINIMAL approach
